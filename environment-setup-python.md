In WSL
- sudo apt install python3-pip
- pip install kafka-python
  - or, better yet, run python3 -m pip install kafka-python
  - or best yet...do a virtual environment
    - first do apt install python3.12-venv
    - then python3 -m venv .venv
    - then source .venv/bin/activate
    - then, finally pip install kafka-python
- pyflink- don't bother installing it...
  - can't really run flink code from dev machine environment, because Flink Runtime isn't installed, and, kafka is connected
